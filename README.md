# planetcoastersavefile
Utilities for working with save game files for the awesome game Planet Coaster.  Written in Python.

## Requirements
- Python 3 (I'm using 3.5.1)
- pip install crcmod

## Disclaimers
- This is just a start.  Don't expect it to do anything useful yet!
- This code might eat your save files and burn your house down, be careful!
- I am in no way affilliated with Frontier Developments and this code is not in any way endorsed by them.
